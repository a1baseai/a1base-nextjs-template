### 📸 Multimedia Messaging

The framework now supports sending and receiving multimedia content through WhatsApp:

#### Supported Media Types
- **Images** (JPG, PNG, GIF, WEBP) - up to 5MB
- **Videos** (MP4, 3GP) - up to 16MB  
- **Audio** (MP3, OGG, AMR, AAC) - up to 16MB
- **Documents** (PDF, DOC, DOCX, etc.) - up to 100MB
- **Location** sharing

#### Sending Media Messages
```typescript
// Using the API endpoint
POST /api/messaging/send-media
{
  "threadType": "individual",
  "recipientId": "+1234567890",
  "mediaUrl": "https://example.com/image.jpg",
  "mediaType": "image",
  "caption": "Check out this product!"
}

// Using workflow functions
import { SendProductImage } from "@/lib/workflows/multimedia-workflow";
await SendProductImage(threadMessages, imageUrl, productName, description, ...);
```

#### Receiving Media Messages
Incoming media is automatically processed and converted to text representations for the AI:
- Images: `[Image received: caption]`
- Videos: `[Video received: caption]`
- Documents: `[Document received: filename]`
- Location: `[Location shared: name at coordinates]`

For detailed multimedia documentation, see [docs/MULTIMEDIA_GUIDE.md](docs/MULTIMEDIA_GUIDE.md).

### 📬 Message Flow

When a message arrives through the webhook, here's the complete flow through the codebase:

1. **Webhook Entry Point** (`app/api/whatsapp/incoming/route.ts`)
   - Receives incoming webhook POST request
   - Validates and parses webhook payload
   - Extracts message details (sender, content, thread info)
   ```typescript:app/api/whatsapp/incoming/route.ts
   ```

2. **Message Handler** (`lib/ai-triage/handle-whatsapp-incoming.ts`)
   - Manages message storage and user data
   - Updates conversation history
   - Triggers message triage
   ```typescript:lib/ai-triage/handle-whatsapp-incoming.ts
   ```

3. **Message Triage** (`lib/ai-triage/triage-logic.ts`)
   - Analyzes message intent using OpenAI
   - Routes to appropriate workflow:
     - Simple responses
     - Identity verification
     - Email handling
     - [Add your own custom triage logic here]
   ```typescript:lib/ai-triage/triage-logic.ts
   ```

4. **Workflow Execution** (`lib/workflows/basic_workflow.ts`)
   - Handles different types of responses:
     - Default replies
     - Identity verification
     - Email composition and sending
     - [Add your own custom workflows here]
   ```typescript:lib/workflows/basic_workflow.ts
   ```

5. **OpenAI Integration** (`lib/services/openai.ts`)
   - Generates AI responses
   - Analyzes message intent
   - Creates email drafts
   ```typescript:lib/services/openai.ts
   ```

Each component can be customized to modify the bot's behavior:
- Adjust webhook handling in the entry point
- Modify message storage and history management
- Update triage logic and workflow routing
- Customize individual workflow implementations
- Fine-tune AI response generation

The system uses environment variables for configuration and can be integrated with Supabase for persistent storage. Safety settings and agent profile configurations can be adjusted through their respective configuration files.

## 🔄 Scheduled Tasks

The template includes a cron job system for automated tasks:
- Configure in `app/api/cron/route.ts`
- Set up scheduled tasks in `lib/cron-job/cron-job.ts`
- Secure with CRON_SECRET environment variable
