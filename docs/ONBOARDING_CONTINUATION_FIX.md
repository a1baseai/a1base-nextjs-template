# Onboarding Continuation Fix

## Problem

After a user provides their name during onboarding, the bot was giving a generic response like "Nice to meet you, Pasha Rayan! Let's dive into getting you set up on A1 Founder Mode." instead of continuing with the next onboarding question (asking for email).

## Root Causes

1. **Weak Field Extraction Logic**: The `extractCollectedFields` function had limited pattern matching that might miss when the bot asked for the name.

2. **Insufficient AI Instructions**: The system prompt wasn't explicit enough about what the AI should do next, allowing it to generate generic responses instead of asking for the specific next field.

3. **Missing Context**: The prompt didn't clearly communicate to the AI what information had already been collected.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Field Extraction (`lib/workflows/onboarding-workflow.ts`)

```typescript
// Added more flexible patterns for name detection
if (!collectedData.name && 
    (assistantText.includes('full name') || 
     assistantText.includes('your name') ||
     assistantText.includes('tell me your name') ||
     assistantText.includes('share your name') ||
     assistantText.includes('what is your name') ||
     assistantText.includes("what's your name"))) {
  collectedData.name = userResponse;
  console.log('[extractCollectedFields] Extracted name:', userResponse);
}
```

### 2. Clearer AI Instructions (`lib/workflows/onboarding-workflow.ts`)

```typescript
// Added explicit instructions about what to do and what NOT to do
const aiPrompt = `${systemPrompt}

You are currently onboarding a new user. ${contextInfo}

Your task now is to ask for the following information in a natural, conversational way:
${fieldInstruction}

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- You MUST ask for the ${nextField.label || nextField.id}
- Ask for ONLY this one piece of information
- Be friendly and acknowledge the user's previous response if applicable
- Do NOT skip ahead or ask about anything else
- Do NOT provide generic statements about "getting started" or "diving in"
- Your response should be a clear question asking for the ${nextField.label || nextField.id}
`;
```

### 3. Better Debugging (`lib/ai-triage/handle-whatsapp-incoming.ts`)

Added comprehensive logging throughout the onboarding follow-up process to track:
- Which fields have been collected
- Which fields still need to be collected
- What prompt is being generated
- What response the AI generates

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Before Fix:
```
User: "Hey July - lets go"
Bot: "Hi there! Before we get started, could you please tell me your full name?"
User: "Pasha Rayan"
Bot: "Nice to meet you, Pasha Rayan! Let's dive into getting you set up on A1 Founder Mode." ❌
```

### After Fix:
```
User: "Hey July - lets go"
Bot: "Hi there! Before we get started, could you please tell me your full name?"
User: "Pasha Rayan"
Bot: "Thanks Pasha Rayan! Could you please share your email address?" ✅
User: "pasha@example.com"
Bot: "Great! Now, what's your biggest dream for your project or startup?" ✅
User: "To build amazing AI tools"
Bot: "Thank you for sharing that information! I'm excited to help you build amazing AI tools..." ✅
```

## Testing

Use the test script to verify the fix:
```bash
node scripts/test-onboarding-continuation.js
```

This script:
1. Sends an initial message to trigger onboarding
2. Provides a name when asked
3. Verifies that the bot asks for email (not a generic response)

## Key Improvements

1. **Robust Extraction**: The field extraction now handles various ways the bot might ask for information
2. **Clear Instructions**: The AI receives explicit instructions about what to ask and what NOT to say
3. **Context Awareness**: The system tells the AI what has already been collected
4. **Better Debugging**: Comprehensive logs help diagnose issues

## Future Improvements

1. **AI-Powered Extraction**: Instead of pattern matching, use AI to extract what information was collected
2. **Field Validation**: Add validation for each field (e.g., email format)
3. **Flexible Ordering**: Allow fields to be collected in any order
4. **Multi-Language Support**: Handle onboarding in different languages
