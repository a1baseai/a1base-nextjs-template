# Railway WebSocket Deployment Fix

## Issue Summary
Your group chat feature is failing in production because WebSocket connections cannot be established to your Railway deployment. This is a common issue with Railway's proxy layer.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Created `railway.json` Configuration
- Added Railway-specific configuration file
- Ensures proper Node.js environment setup
- Configures restart policies for reliability

### 2. Updated Server WebSocket Configuration (`server.js`)
- Added Railway-compatible Socket.IO settings
- Enabled WebSocket compression
- Increased timeout values for better reliability
- Added buffering support for slow connections

### 3. Updated Client WebSocket Configuration (`hooks/useSocketGroupChat.ts`)
- Changed transport order: polling first, then upgrade to WebSocket
- Added production-specific connection settings
- Improved error resilience

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Variables on Railway
Ensure these are set in your Railway dashboard:

```bash
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=8080
HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0

# Your existing variables
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key
A1BASE_API_KEY=your_key
A1BASE_API_SECRET=your_secret
A1BASE_ACCOUNT_ID=your_account_id
A1BASE_AGENT_NUMBER=your_number
A1BASE_AGENT_EMAIL=your_email
A1BASE_AGENT_NAME=your_agent_name
SUPABASE_URL=your_url
SUPABASE_KEY=your_key
```

### 2. Deploy to Railway
```bash
# Commit the changes
git add .
git commit -m "Fix WebSocket configuration for Railway deployment"
git push origin main
```

Railway will automatically redeploy with the new configuration.

### 3. Verify Deployment
After deployment:
1. Check Railway logs for "Socket.IO server running"
2. Test group chat at: `https://a1foundermode.up.railway.app/chat/[chatId]`
3. Monitor browser console for successful WebSocket connections

## Additional Notes

### About the Token Error
The error `Error fetching token: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'token')` appears to be from a browser extension (content.js) and is unrelated to your application. You can safely ignore it or disable browser extensions when testing.

### Monitoring WebSocket Connections
In production, you should see:
- Initial connection via HTTP polling
- Upgrade to WebSocket after successful handshake
- Stable "connected" status in the chat UI

### Troubleshooting
If issues persist:
1. Check Railway logs for any error messages
2. Ensure all environment variables are set correctly
3. Try accessing the site in an incognito window (no extensions)
4. Contact Railway support about WebSocket proxy settings

### Alternative Solutions
If Railway continues to have WebSocket issues, consider:
1. **Render.com** - Better WebSocket support out of the box
2. **Fly.io** - Excellent WebSocket handling
3. **DigitalOcean App Platform** - Reliable WebSocket support
4. **Heroku** - Mature WebSocket implementation

## Testing Locally
To test the production configuration locally:
```bash
NODE_ENV=production npm run dev
```

This will use the same transport settings as production.
